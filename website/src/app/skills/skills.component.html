            Like with many programmers, it all started of with HTML and CSS,
            later also SCSS. My first contact with HTML& CSS was back in my teen
            days, spending some time redesigning WordPress sites. After learning
            the basics of HTML and CSS it was time to learn my first serious
            programming language. I have been developing with JS since 2019,
            although not as much as with TypeScript.

            Have been developing with Angular since 2019. I really appreciate
            the architecture of this framework, which in contrast to React made
            it easier to understand.

            C# was my first OOP (Object Orientated Programming) language which I
            learned and currently am still further improving. Some small
            projects have been developed with this language.

            My first contact with Java was through my time at IT-school in Bern,
            CH. I have developed numerous smaller projects with Java, although
            nothing very sophisticated yet.

            Through my time at the robotics department at Swisscom I had the
            opportunity to gain knowledge and skills for this automation
            software which I also certified on.

            Visual Basic for Applications was another language I needed to pick
            up in the automation world, which improved various steps with
            Automation Anywhere in terms of efficiency and performance. Excel
            was the main application which I used VBA for.
